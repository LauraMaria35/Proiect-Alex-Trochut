                    <p>Alex Trochut was born in 1981 in Barcelona, Spain. After completing his studies at Elisava Escola
                        Superior de Disseny, Alex established his own design studio in Barcelona before relocating to
                        New York City. Through his design, illustration and typographic practice he has developed an
                        intuitive way of working that has resulted in his expressive visual style.
                        <br><br>
                        For Alex, typography functions on two hierarchical levels. First, there is the image of the word
                        we see; reading comes secondary. As a designer, Alex focuses on the potential of language as a
                        visual medium, pushing language to its limits so that seeing and reading become the same action
                        and text and image become one unified expression.
                        <br><br>
                        Mixing styles and genres and drawing equally from pop culture, street culture, fashion and
                        music, Alex has created design, illustration and typography for a diverse range of clients:
                        Nike, Adidas, The Rolling Stones, Katy Perry, BBC, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, The Guardian, The New York
                        Times, Time Magazine and many others. Alex’s work has been internationally recognized, appearing
                        in in exhibitions and publications worldwide. He has given talks and been honored by the Art
                        Directors Club––including being named a 2008 Young Gun––the Type Directors Club, Creative
                        Review, Cannes, Clio and D&AD among others. His monograph, More Is More, explores his working
                        methodologies and influences and was published in 2011.
                        <br><br>
                        Alex currently lives and works in Brooklyn.

My first jobs were in Berlin, at Moniteurs and Xplicit. Then I went back to Barcelona where I worked  at Toormix and Vasava. Since 2007 I’ve been freelancing and mostly focusing on illustration and lettering. A year ago I switched Barcelona for New York.</p><br><h3>DB: What’s been the biggest influence on your work?</h3><p>AT: The people closest to me. The great masters of american graphic design such as Herb Lubalin, Saul Bass, Milton Glaser and Paul Rand. Mediterranean artists like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí. Wizards of geometry like Victor Vasarely, Carlos Cruz-Diez, or M. C. Escher. And pop artists like Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, KAWS. I also like very much the work of illustrators Rick Griffin and Jim Phillips.</p><br><h3>DB: How would you describe your work to someone who hasn’t seen it before?</h3><p>AT: My work is expressive. It’s often highly detailed but the overall image is clean. I have a tendency to mix geometric and fluid forms. Ambiguity and duality are also recurrent themes in my concepts as are letters, numbers and symbols.</p><br><h3>DB: How did you come to develop the complex style of typography demonstrated in a lot of your work?</h3><p>AT: For me it’s very important to try do same things in terms of images but in different ways or styles, this is sometimes the goal and concept itself. Often the most challenging part of the process is to figure out the methodology. I try to get lost, discover happy accidents and break my routines. Normally it’s hard to find a client that likes to experiment and take the risks that this process implies, so usually I collect my ‘accidents’ and save them for the right occasion.</p><br><h3>DB: How would you describe the evolution in your work?</h3><p>AT: The most important goal for me when I started to design was to make an impact, through direct, bold images. Highlighting that a good deal of time had been spent creating them. I worked a lot on details to make a very intricate compositions. Now I’m looking to achieve a less artificial result, for something more spontaneous in it’s aesthetic but still with a direct, strong impact. if we think of images as flavors, before I was cooking with sweeter ingredients, but now I’m trying to achieve a bitter taste – a flavor that you develop a craving for.</p><br><h3>DB: What has been your most satisfying project to date?</h3><p>AT: <span>Binary prints</span>, which is a self-funded personal project that I launched last year. It is a printing technique that I patented, which allows you to print two completely different images on the same surface – one visible in light the other in the dark. it was the first time that I’ve invested so much time and efforts on a personal project, and it has been very rewarding for me, especially the fact that it forced me to step into a zone where I didn’t feel safe and to look at things from a different point of view; one that was less commercial.</p><br><p>You can read the whole interview <a href=https://www.designboom.com/design/alex-trochut-interview-12-23-2013/ target=_blank>here</a>.</p><br></div>";

The font is a visual language present in everything that is human communication. For example, we could go to a Japanese supermarket, we wouldn’t be able to understand anything but we would be able to know some things from the design of the font.</p><br><h3>Can a print design be done with “everything”?</h3><p>The only limit to being able to make a design is the imagination of the designer.</p><br><h3>Do you think typography and printing can ever play a technological role in creating artistic products such as your Binary prints?</h3><p>Yes, of course it can help. Now more traditional techniques are starting to be used again, and it’s very notable especially in the use of ‘lettering’ and ‘calligraphy’ somehow these more classical techniques are being combined with the most recent.</p><br><h3>The union between music and art – do you consider it reinforces the work on show?</h3><p>Yes, people need to be able to connect with an exhibition and look for points in common. In the case of  “Binary prints” I used electronic music because I was looking for complicity with the spectator. I think that if I had done the work on my own it would have lost a lot, and the musicians are bringing a lot to my piece with their work.</p><br><h3>What are the characteristics of a good slogan with typography?</h3><p>Depends on the context. First the text, I prefer a shorter, because although there are fewer letters one can make them stand out more.</p><br><h3>What projects do you have lined up?</h3><p>I have plans to work on and develop more “Binary prints” but the next few projects are more to do with training. I am very thrilled to be as a student taking classes in different fields and learning from these.</p><br><h3>Which artist has most influenced your work?</h3><p>I feel very identified with artists ranging from Dalí to Picasso.</p><br><h3>What work of art do you never tire of seeing?</h3><p>“The persistence of memory” of Salvador Dalí.</p><br><p>You can read the whole interview <a href=https://www.magazinehorse.com/en/interview-to-alex-trochut/ target=_blank>here</a>.<p><br></div>";
